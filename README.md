# Simple Admin

A small, no frills admin project designed to give me easy CRUD access to a project's database. This project was done primarily to get some practical experience using React (with Typescript) for the front-end, Flask (Python) for the back-end, and GraphQL.

[You can learn more about this project and the decisions I made on my website here](https://stracey.dev/projects/admin).

The end user needs for this project were pretty simple and so the intention was to keep the project small enough so that it could be built in 1-2 weekends and allow me to tinker with some frameworks / technologies that I hadn't had the chance to use much yet.

Additionally since the project is mostly just reptitive tables, I wanted to see just how small I could keep the component by having tables dynamically generate there columns and contents based on the model being returned by the API.

_Also I know it doesn't look pretty._
